For creating a web application with Python programming language, most popular frameworks for building a web application are Flask and Django. In this exercise, I will focus more on Django and give examples on what tools to use for linting, testing and building. Django has a wide variety of linting packages available to use, [pylint-django](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django) being one of the most popular ones. Django provides a testing framework built on top of unittest that can test both integration and unit tests. Tests can be run with `py manage.py test` command. Testing tools and available commands are already built in Django. Since Django uses Python, no specific building is required, but for deploying a Django application, you must follow a checklist and do some configuration, for example disabling the DEBUG option in the settings.py file or making sure your SECRET_KEY is actually hidden in production. The checklist can be followed with this command: `manage.py check --deploy`.

There are different alternatives to both Jenkins and GitHub Actions available. For self-hosted environments, TeamCity, Strider and Bamboo are good alternatives, although Jenkins is the most popular one. For cloud-based environments, good alternatives are CircleCI, GitLab and AWS CodePipeline. Before picking your environment, you might need to consider what are your needs.

Configuring a cloud-based environment is generally more simpler to do. The decision between a self-hosted and cloud-based depends also on the size of your project. For smaller projects, cloud-based environment is usually the best choice since smaller projects do not require large hardware capacities. Self-hosted environments on the other hand tend to be more customizable than cloud-based. You can configure your CI to your needs by including all the necessary plugins and by controlling your resources. Self-hosted environments require more responsibility since you have to take care of your infrastructure, servers, making sure the software is always up-to-date and security. The choice between both environments, come down to the amplitude of your project.

For a simple Django application, cloud-based environment would be a good fit.
